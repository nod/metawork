# Components

There are four primary areas that contribute to determining progress through our
levels.

- Technical Ability & Experience
- Communication
- Critical Thinking
- Initiative

## Technical Ability & Experience

How well does the researcher perform the technical skills needed to be
successful?  Is the researcher adept at coding, reverse engineering, etc?  How
deep has a researcher gone within a particular platform?  How many targets has a
researcher successfully targetted?  How much "been there, done that" does the
individual exhibit?

## Communication

How well does the researcher communicate with the team, with other researchers,
with junior staff looking to learn? How well does the researcher communicate
with the greater security community at large?

## Critical Thinking

Is the researcher able to think around difficult problems and derive new methods
of finding a solution?  Can the researcher balance short-term needs with
long-term company goals with regards to research areas and deliverables?  Does
the researcher know when to take a break from a particular target and move on to
either another avenue of attack or another target completely?

## Initiative

How scrappy is the individual?  Do they take ownership?  Do they follow through
to the end or abandon something in favor of the next shiny target?

# Descriptions

It is important to keep aware that these are not rigid guidelines but more of an
area of general progress.

## R0: Vulnerability Research Intern

**Role:** Learn. Be helpful. Ask lots of questions. Work Hard. Follow the 1 hour
help-team rule[^htr].

**Typical Research Duration:** 1-6 weeks

**Scope:** within single project

**Anti-patterns:** Ignores the help-team rule. Afraid to try big new things.
Insists on only working on hardest problems.

**Experience:** ~0-1 years

## R1: Vulnerability Researcher I

**Role:** Focus on the simpler targets to help the team meet quotas. Collaborate
with others on medium and harder reports. With spare time, learn new techniques
to advance your skills and become more useful to the team.

**Typical Research Duration:** 1-3 weeks

**Scope:** Within single team, focused on individual research targets

**Anti-patterns:** Attempt hard targets without guidance. Ignores the 1 hour
help-team rule. Slow to take on new work, too slow to admit needs help.

**Experience:** ~0-2 years

## R2: Vulnerability Researcher II

**Role:** Develop POCs and exploits for simple to medium targets.  Collaborate
with the team to deliver reports.

**Typical Research Duration:** 2 weeks - 6 weeks

**Scope:** Within single team, focused on multiple research targets

**Anti-patterns:** Attempts hard targets against guidance, spins and spins
without results. Or the contrary: focuses exclusively on ultra-simple targets.
Does not balance simple targets for delivery with harder targets for learning
and expanding knowledge.

**Experience:** ~1-3 years

## R3: Vulnerability Researcher III

**Role:** Develop POCs and exploits for variety of targets.  Leads collaborative
efforts in producing research.

**Typical Research Duration:** 3 weeks - 3 months

**Scope:** Primarily within single team, mentors others in group as
opportunities arise

**Anti-patterns:** Does not balance simple targets for delivery with harder
targets for learning and expanding knowledge.  Does not collaborate across skill
levels to improve own skills and mentor others.

**Experience:** ~2-5 years

## R4: Senior Vulnerability Researcher

**Role:** Performs more advanced research against a wide variety of targets.
Represents company at regional and national conferences.

**Typical Research Duration:** 3 weeks - 4 months

**Scope:** Sets tone of research excellence for entire group

**Anti-patterns:** Produces low quality work, or very slow in research progress.
Disregards guidance of team lead when selecting targets.

**Experience:** ~3-6 years

## R5: Principal Vulnerability Researcher

**Role:** Develop exploits for variety of targets but primarily specializes in
one platform.  Serve as SME for one or more platforms for other researchers.
Guides development of group by example and research gravitas. Represents company
at top tier conferences.

**Typical Research Duration:** 3 months - 8 months

**Scope:** sets tone of research excellence for entire company

**Anti-patterns:** Absent from research culture. May make research progress but
does not share or work with others to advance the craft.

**Experience:** ~5-10 years

## R6: Vulnerability Research Fellow

**Role:** Performs research of the highest caliber. Invents new attack methods.
Familiar with multiple platforms but recognized expert in at least one.
Represents company as world respected researcher.

**Typical Research Duration:** months to years

**Scope:** Sets tone of research excellence for industry.

**Anti-patterns:** Absent from research culture. May make research progress but
does not share or work with others to advance the craft.

**Experience:** ~10+ years

# Notes

## What is the help-team rule?

Help the team before (and by) asking for help.

If you immediately ask for help as you encounter a problem, you're not helping
your team first. Ideally you would chew on a problem for an hour, a day,
whatever is appropriate to the size of the task. You'd research it, do web
searches, dive into code. After some (admittedly nebulous) period of time, you
will ask for help.  If you continue to search in vain, you are no longer helping
yourself or your team by being stuck.

**tl;dr** - If you ask before searching, you're wasting the team's time. If you
stubbornly search too long, you're also wasting the team's time.
